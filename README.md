Developer resources to supplement ETHBoulder 2026 talk on "Private Payments in Practice: Integrating Zcash from Scratch to Production".

## Abstract
Privacy-preserving payments are critical infrastructure for the decentralized web, but how do they actually work in production? A hands-on developer perspective on building with Zcash payment processors, exploring multiple approaches with different trade-offs in privacy, control, and complexity: running your own node for full control, deploying BTCPayServer with the Zcash plugin for production-ready self-hosted processing, and using lightweight solutions like Zgo for quick integration without infrastructure overhead. Drawing from real implementation experience, attendees will leave with practical code examples, deployment patterns, and a realistic understanding of what it takes to build privacy-first payment systems today.
